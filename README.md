# S-Recipes

Side project created mainly with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)

[Check it out here](https://srecipes.hbieszczad.pl/)

More details:
## Astro
#### I just wanted to give it a try with more complex project than simple static site, and I had so much fun building that
- SSR
- fetching data at server level
- lazy js loading

## Astro SPA
#### Although at that moment this project crawls it has so much great features and I wish it would have more love and downloads in the near future
- routing
- prefetching pages

## Svelte
#### Just great for building user interfaces, really simple reactions and many more stuff
- building components
- storing data

## PocketBase
#### Really simple way to have backend, basic js client isn't perfect but I enchanced it with use of pocketbase-typegen and some additional typescript to make it super cool and easy to use
- API
- database
- authentication

# TailwindCSS
#### Easy and great for styling!
- styles

You can browse for recipes, add new one, delete them. It has simple filtering system based on either category or recipe title. Prefetching and server side rendering makes this app extremaly fast and lightweight.
